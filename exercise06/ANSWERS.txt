# Exercise 6
## 6.1
### 1
See code.
### 2
Here we want visibility of recent potential operations on the map, and as such
we lock prior to reading the size of each bucket.
### 3
See code.
### 4
See code.
### 5
See code.
### 6
We have implemented version 2 as it performs slightly better than version 1,
since we lock a stripe and then operate on it, instead of locking all stripes before locking.
### 7
We did this and all assertions passed. The output was:

class StripedMap
        17 maps to B
       117 maps to C
        34 maps to F
        17 maps to B
       217 maps to E
        34 maps to F
        17 maps to B
       217 maps to E
        34 maps to F
        17 maps to B
       217 maps to E
