## 5.3
### 1
It works

### 2
See code: We got 7 unresponsive pages, but left them in.

### 3
Below is results, where time is time from start of experiment.
Sequential rep 0, time: 10.233204
Sequential rep 1, time: 16.096665
Sequential rep 2, time: 21.034460
Sequential rep 3, time: 25.209228
Sequential rep 4, time: 29.653033

The fastests run was rep 3, and rep 0 was the slowest.

### 4
Parallel rep 0, time: 1.712778
Parallel rep 1, time: 4.041850
Parallel rep 2, time: 6.193783
Parallel rep 3, time: 8.078128
Parallel rep 4, time: 9.938540

A lot quicker.

### 5
It's not 23 times faster due to pages taking various time to retrieve.
As such it will be influenced heavily by the slowest one and have that be a larger
part of the total time, where it will a smaller factor for the sequential one.

## 5.4
### 1
That worked nicely!

### 2
See code for the Uniquifier.
Before below appeared twice:

With the uniquifier this now only appears once.
