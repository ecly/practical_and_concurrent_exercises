# Exercise week 2
## Exercise 2.1
### 1
The result is correct and it took 6 seconds to complete.

### 2
See code.

### 3
With the updated code we still get the correct result,
and it now only takes 2.8 seconds to complete.

### 4
This is not possible as there will be lost updates.

### 5
Final is not necessary as we never change the pointer for count.

## Exercise 2.2
### 1
We need to ensure that our program knows that the cache can change at any point, so we always need to check if it has changed  when we use it.

### 2
This is a trick question. The final keyword is not needed with current implementation.
